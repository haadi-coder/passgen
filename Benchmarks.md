# Password Generator Benchmarks

This document presents the performance benchmarks for the `passgen` package across four optimization iterations. Each iteration reflects improvements made to the password generation algorithm, with key changes noted below. The benchmarks measure operations per second (`ops/sec`), time per operation (`ns/op`), memory usage (`B/op`), and number of allocations (`allocs/op`) for various test cases.

## Benchmark Iterations

- **#1**: Initial implementation.
- **#2**: Optimized `shuffleString` with buffered values.
- **#3**: Optimized `generatePassEntry` for reduced allocations.
- **#4**: Optimized `Generate` by transitioning from strings to runes, minimizing cross-type conversions.

## Observations

- **Performance Improvements**: Each iteration significantly improves performance, with iteration #4 achieving the highest operations per second and lowest memory usage across all test cases.
- **Short Passwords**: The `short_password` test case shows the most significant improvement, reaching 891,266 ops/sec in iteration #4, due to reduced allocations and faster execution.
- **Long Passwords**: The `long_password` test case remains the slowest due to its length (64 characters), but iteration #4 reduces memory usage by ~87% compared to #1.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Iteration #4 minimizes allocations (down to 5â€“12 per operation) by using runes instead of strings, avoiding cross-type conversions.
- **Digits Only**: The `digits_only` test case shows a slight regression in time from iteration #3 to #4 (1,949 ns to 2,044 ns), possibly due to overhead in rune handling, but memory usage remains low.

## Notes

- **Ops/sec** is calculated as `1,000,000,000 / ns/op` to represent the number of operations per second.
- Benchmarks were run on a system with 12 CPU cores (indicated by `-12` in the output).
- Further optimizations could focus on reducing memory allocations for longer passwords or investigating the slight performance regression in the `digits_only` case.
